### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Onyewuchi Emeka Manuel

### About Me
I am a front-end and MERN stack developer. I am keen on improving my front-end skills along side my javaScript skills. I'm currently working on a few projects which I upload to my Github repo. Looking to collab on any javaScript-based project. Feel free to ask me about anything. Your contributions to my repos would be appreciated. Some day I hope to land a developer role in a top tech institution.
